## ⚡ Beyond a Website. An Experience.

Welcome to **Aaditya's Digital Consciousness**. This is not just a static portfolio; it is an interactive, futuristic "Operating System" designed to showcase the intersection of rigorous backend logic and high-end "Vibe Coding" aesthetics.

Built to demonstrate **AI Automation** and **Scalable Systems**, every pixel in this application serves a purpose—proving that code can be both functional art and a powerful business tool.

## 🚀 Features

### 🤖 AdityaAI (Neural Avatar)
A fully integrated AI chatbot powered by **Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash**.
- Acts as a digital twin, answering recruiter questions about skills, availability, and technical background.
- Context-aware and persona-driven ("Cyberpunk Professional").

### ⚔️ Man Vs. Machine
An interactive **GSAP** visualization that contrasts the "Old Way" of manual labor with the "Aaditya Way" of automated pipelines.
- **Manual Mode:** A frantic, matrix-rain aesthetic showing the chaos of manual tasks.
- **Automated Mode:** A sleek, GSAP-animated pipeline demonstrating data ingestion, cleaning, and value generation.

### 📟 Terminal of Truth
A functional Command Line Interface (CLI) for power users.
- Type `scan` to run a simulated network probe.
- Type `python3` to enter a Python shell simulation.
- Type `pip install` to simulate package installations.
- Hacker-style Matrix rain overlay available via `/theme matrix`.

### 🌌 Skill Gravity Well
A physics-based interactive canvas where skills (Python, Docker, GenAI) float and collide.
- Uses 2D physics to simulate gravity and collisions.
- Interact with the mouse to "explode" the skill cloud.

### 🔐 Contact Vault
A gamified "Monolith" security system.
- Users must manually "click to breach" the firewall (20 clicks) to unlock the contact form.
- Once unlocked, reveals a sleek, assembly-line style contact interface with sound effects.

### 🪐 Experience Solar System
A radial, orbiting visualization of my career path.
- The "Sun" represents my core education (RGPV).
- Orbiting planets represent internships and roles (IBM, Google Cloud, Shell), rotating at different speeds.

### 🧪 The Lab
An experimental playground with floating, colliding project nodes using elastic collision physics.

## 🧠 Philosophy

> *"Manual labor is a bug. Automation is the patch."*

This portfolio is a manifesto. It rejects the boring, static resume in favor of a dynamic, living system. It proves that a Full-Stack Engineer should be able to build tools that are not only robust and scalable but also **unforgettable**.
